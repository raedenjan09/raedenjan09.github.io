                <li>Keyframes</li>
              </ul>
              In the firt week, I focused on learning the basics of rotoscoping using Adobe After Effects. I practiced using the Roto Brush tool to isolate subjects from their backgrounds and applied the Puppet Tool to animate specific parts of the subject. Keyframes were used to create smooth transitions and movements.

              </ul>
              In the second week, I transitioned to using Flipaclip for frame-by-frame animation. I utilized the Pen Tool to draw and animate characters, while layers helped me manage different elements of the animation. Onion skinning was essential for ensuring smooth transitions between frames, allowing me to see previous and next frames while drawing.

              </ul>
              In the third week, I continued to refine my skills in Flipaclip. I focused on creating more complex animations by combining multiple layers and utilizing the Pen Tool for detailed drawings. The onion skinning feature was crucial for maintaining consistency in character movements and ensuring fluidity in the animation.

              </ul>
              In the fourth week, I delved deeper into Flipaclip's features, experimenting with different brush styles and layer effects. I continued to use the Pen Tool for precise animations and layers to separate foreground and background elements. Onion skinning helped me maintain a cohesive flow in my animations, allowing for smoother transitions between frames.This week, I also explored the use of backgrounds ive downloaded online-to enhance the visual appeal of my animations. I learned how to import and integrate these backgrounds into my projects, adding depth and context to my animated scenes.
